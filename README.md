# Pokedéx

A small simple Pokédex site, which uses pokeapi to fetch information about the pokémon.
User can search pokémon by their name or their national ID. Found pokémon are saved on local cache, for faster usage and to limit unnecessary requests towards the API.

The site has been build using React and bootstrap. Building it has teached me things relating to things like fetch, async, useEffect, localStorage and grid-based layouting.

There's still things I may add to the project. Currently the amount of information that the site serves about the pokemon is limited. 
I also wish to learn customizing SASS and to create bit more eye-friendly theme.
I am also aware the site is lacking accessibility, which I want to change in the future.
